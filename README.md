# Modern-Todo-List

🌟I've successfully built a dynamic Todo List using HTML, CSS, and Javascript! 📝✨
🚀 This feature-packed app includes active todos, completed todos, and a list of all todos. But that's not all - it's designed to catch empty inputs, ensuring a seamless user experience💡, and it even comes with a day and night mode for added flexibility. Plus, it keeps track of your todo count.
